Everything should work if you open `index.html` in Google Chrome. I haven't tested in other browsers but I can't imagine any browser up to modern standards wouldn't work equivalently.

My stylesheets load fonts from Google Fonts and the page uses an image carousel script from an external content delivery network, so an internet connection is required for everything to load properly.

It also appears that—despite my efforts—certain features of the page do not function on mobile browsers, so to see everything the site has to offer, please view it on a desktop or laptop at 16:9 aspect ratio (widescreen).
