					<div class="info">
						<!-- PREMISE -->
						<h2>Premise</h2>

						<p>
							In <span class="whoa-neo">Last Light,</span> you'll face 7 waves of zombies, each growing more
							difficult to defeat than the last. The increase in difficulty forces the player to adapt against
							decreasing odds, keeping the stakes high and gameplay dynamic. Players will work as a team, gather
							props to build barricades and hold back zombies long enough to escape.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once they've survived to the end of the 7<sup>th</sup>
							wave, you and the rest of the survivors on your team will make a run for one of several
							random exits placed throughout one of the game's several levels, fighting off any zombies
							scattered around and scrounging about looking for the brains of any survivors who happen to pass
							by.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's a frantic dash to finish off the match that keeps players on edge and a great way to close out
							the game.
						</p>

						<!-- MECHANICS -->
						<h2>Mechanics</h2>

						<p>
							So, you might be wondering: "How do I stay alive for 7 waves when I'm essentially
							trapped in a box with zombies trying to kill me the entire time?"
						</p>
						<p>
							You can't; this is where the game's most important mechanics come into play.
						</p>
						<p>
							While you may not be able to hold them off <i>forever,</i> you can <i>avoid</i> the problem temporarily by building a barricade.
							Barricades buy you time, putting life-saving distance between yourselves and the zombies. The game's barricading mechanics are
							crucial to survival, and learning how to maneuver around them will be the difference between surviving to the 7<sup>th</sup> wave or
							getting whacked because you were standing too close to an opening.
						</p>
						<img src="img/screenshots/barricading_1.webp" width="700" />
						<p>
							Affixing a prop to the world with hammer and nail provides it with a healthbar, allowing zombies
							to destroy it by attacking it. Props incorporated into barricades that have been damaged by zombies
							can be repaired by hitting them with a hammer. This is usually done by the player who built the
							barricade; building and maintaining barricades is a complex task, so it is best for at least one
							player to dedicate themselves to this cause. The rest of the players use both ranged and melee weapons to
							fend off the zombies through gaps in the assembled barricades, thinning their numbers long enough for the barricade
							to withstand their attacks until the end of the 7<sup>th</sup> wave.
						</p>
						<p>
							Humans can "phase" through barricades as though they weren't even there, allowing them to transport themselves from one side to the other.
							However, their movement speed is reduced considerably during this process, leaving them vulnerable to any zombies attacking the barricade
							as pass through it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Teamwork is essential; each player has a role, and effective coordination is critical to ensure the team and everyone on it isn't overwhelmed.

						<p>
							Levels in the game are filled with physics-enabled props players can pick up, reposition, reorient
							and fasten to the world to build barricades with. The diversity of these props allows for much
							creativity; different materials have different properties and strengths, and clever players will
							experiment to find the most effective setups. Reinforcing barricades, setting traps and funneling
							enemies through chokepoints are just some of the strategies that players could use to their advantage.
						</p>

						<!-- AESTHETIC -->
						<h2>Aesthetic</h2>

						<p>
							Stylistically, I would prefer that the game takes place in the universe of Valve Software's <span class="whoa-neo">Half-Life 2.</span>
							As mentioned above, Valve have historically been very lenient with the licensing of their Source engine and
							the use of their assets by other studios for the development of third-party games in Source, so I'm not too concerned about that.
						</p>
						<p>
							If we end up pivoting to Source 2, we could certainly shift to the style of <span class="whoa-neo">Half-Life: Alyx</span>
							without compromising our vision of a <span class="whoa-neo">Half-Life</span>-themed game. Source 2's advancements in lighting, shading
							and environmental interaction would elevate the game's visuals and improve player experience.
						</p>
						<p>
							The scenes pictured were constructed by myself with the assets from Valve titles such as
							<span class="whoa-neo">Half-Life 2</span> and <span class="whoa-neo">Half-Life 2: Episode One,</span> in addition to some original assets
							of my own (more about the external assets under the <span class="whoa-neo">How Is It Being Made</span> section). They represent the tone
							I want to achieve: Dark, moody, filled with danger. Surviving in a world that feels lived-in and believable.
						</p>

						<!-- VOICE ACTING -->
						<h2>Voice Acting</h2>

						<p>
							When it comes to other kinds of assets, voice acting is one area that may be of concern to people interested in the project. Rest assured,
							there is no shortage of voice lines available to Source engine developers in the goldmine of first-party <span class="whoa-neo">Half-Life</span>
							assets available to them. Regardless, were this not the case, I and several individuals I'm familiar with are reasonably experienced with voice acting and
							currently possess the equipment necessary to produce the studio-quality voice recordings one would expect from a production of this caliber.
						</p>
						<p>
							So, voice acting is an aspect of the game's development I've got on lock.
						</p>

						<!-- MUSIC -->
						<h2>Music</h2>

						<p>
							I plan to have a dynamic music system for the game. What this means in simple terms is that I aim to have created a number of looping tracks
							to be seamlessly layered over one another by a system programmed to measure the "mood" of the game at any moment in time. For example, when
							combat is building up, so does the music. I believe tailored music samples and a carefully designed music system to accodomate them would
							accomplish this to great effect.
						</p>
						<p>
							The music will have moments of quiet tension and high crescendos as players encounter groups of zombies or reach critical points in the game loop.
							The goal is to use music as a tool to build suspense, heighten emotion and provide an additional layer of sensory feedback to players, letting them
							know when they're in danger and when they've got a moment to rest.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="basic">
					<h1>How Is It Being Made?</h2>

					<div class="info">
						<!-- ENGINE -->
						<h2>Engine Tech</h2>

						<img src="img/screenshots/hammer_1.webp" width="700" />
						<p>
							The game is built on Valve's Source engine, which brings with it a number of complications <i>as well as</i>
							a number of benefits. Working in Source provides an opportunity to tap into a well-known and versatile
							game engine, known for its (albeit somewhat dated) physics simulation. However, it does come with
							challenges that any developer working in this engine will face.
						</p>

						<!-- ASSETS -->
						<h2>Asset Acquisition</h2>

						<p>
							For example, Valve allows textures and materials to be taken directly from first-party Source engine
							games (ones they've made), so long as they are used in commercial games running on Source (not ported
							across engines) and do not contain Valve trademarks (such as characters, logos, etc.). This would allow
							us to forego investing much time, effort and money into creating original assets for certain aspects
							of worldbuilding when said aspects already exist in Valve's first-party Source games.
						</p>
						<p>
							Leveraging those assets will allow us to create a world that feels familiar, immersive and true to the aesthetic of not
							only the <span class="whoa-neo">Half-Life</span> franchise I hope to align with, but other games built on Source that I
							and so many others in the space grew up playing.
						</p>
						<p>
							Pertaining to the issue of trademarks, it would certainly be possible to create a game "taking place"
							in the <span class="whoa-neo">Half-Life</span> universe without creating a "<span class="whoa-neo">Half-Life</span> game."
							Avoiding trademarks will not be difficult, as the <span class="whoa-neo">Half-Life</span> universe does not make heavy use of
							them. We can create a game with with the atmosphere of <span class="whoa-neo">Half-Life</span> without mentioning specific
							characters like "Gordon Freeman" or "Alyx Vance."
						</p>
						<p>
							Even if we paid absolutely no mind to the issue of trademarks, there have been licensed Source games in
							the past that have paid no mind to the <span class="whoa-neo">Half-Life</span> intellectual property and Valve haven't paid any
							mind to it at all. So I foresee no issues, and this gives us a lot of freedom in the way we approach storytelling and
							worldbuilding, whilst still honoring the spirit of the games from which we draw our aesthetic inspiration.
						</p>
						<p>
							As far as complications go, see the <span class="whoa-neo">Potential Budget</span> section below.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="basic">
					<h1>Potential Budget</h1>

					<div class="info">
						<p>
							The history of licensed third-party games built on the Source engine is a confusing and unfortunately
							expensive one. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The licensing cost for third-party Source games was formerly $25,000 per title, and only
							applied to commercial games and/or mods. This is due to the Source engine's reliance upon the independently
							licensed Havok physics engine, which by itself was originally licensed for an estimated $50,000&ndash;$60,000
							per title (and negotiated by Valve to a lesser price for Source titles as it was mandatory middleware for the
							engine's operation).
						</p>
						<p>
							Fortunately, in 2021, the Havok licensing fee for use with Valve engines was waived in an agreement between Valve
							and Microsoft (the parent company of Havok). The license is now free.
						</p>
						<p>
							There is unfortunately very little public licensing information available, as much information pertinent to the
							subject of budgeting can be acquired only under NDA. Most information that was leaked regarding the subject was
							leaked before the Havok licensing fee had been waived, so it's difficult to give reliable figures.
						</p>
						<p>
							For a more realistic budget, assuming that our developers are working part-time jobs to support themselves, I can
							significantly reduce the estimates of our living expenses. Instead, I'm going to allocate a smaller stipend for
							core project work:
							<ul>
								<li><b>Developer Stipends (3 developers, 18 months, part-time):</b><br /><span class="whoa-neo">$500</span> per month, per developer, totaling <span class="whoa-neo">$27,000</span></li><br />
								<li><b>Engine Tech & Misc. Expenses:</b><br />Estimated at <span class="whoa-neo">$12,000</span></li><br />
								<li><b>Marketing & Promotion:</b><br />Estimated at <span class="whoa-neo">$3,000</span> for online campaigns, social media ads and promotional events to generate pre-launch interest.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="whoa-neo">Total: $42,000</span>
						</p>
						<div class="chart">
							<table class="charts-css pie show-heading">
								<!-- <caption>Budget Distribution</caption> -->
								<thead>
									<tr>
										<th scope="col"> Dev. Stipends </th>

									</tr>
								</tbody>
							</table>
						</div>
						<p>
							We could also be looking at Valve licensing Source 2 sometime in the next 5 years, which could substantially change
							the course of development; the radical shift in available engine technology and availability of assets from <span class="whoa-neo">Half-Life: Alyx</span>
							are certainly enticing prospects for us.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="basic">
					<!-- PROJECT TIMELINE -->
					<h1>Project Timeline</h1>

					<div class="info">
						<p>
							Our plan is to get <span class="whoa-neo">Last Light</span> out within 18 months:
							<ol>
								<li>
									<b>Pre-Production (3 months):</b><br />Concept development, planning and asset gathering, as well as setting up collaboration software.
									This phase includes brainstorming and experimenting with different ideas until we find the best ones to move forward with.
								</li><br />
								<li>
									<b>Core Development (9 months):</b><br />Building game mechanics, level design, asset integration (engine tools) and implementation of core features.
									I'll focus on "bringing it to life" during this phase, putting the levels together, fleshing out the core systems (such as barricading), combat mechanics
									and finally ensuring the result is fun for players.
								</li><br />
								<li>
									<b>Testing and Iteration (3 months):</b><br />Alpha testing, internal playtesting, fixing bugs and refining gameplay based on feedback.
									I plan to invite select playtesters to give us feedback, allowing us to get fresh perspectives and new outlooks on the game to make
									proper adjustments.
								</li><br />
								<li>
									<b>Polish and Finalization (3 months):</b><br />Final bug fixes, optimization, polish, marketing preparations and preparing for release.
									During this phase, I want to make sure everything's running smoothly, optimize performance across the board, and apply finishing touches to
									make sure the game mechanics and visuals look and feel just right. I'll also ramp up our marketing and community engagement.
								</li>
							</ol>
						</p>
						<p>
							The timeline above is a very rough estimate and should be expected to change with unforeseen challenges or changes in scope,
							but it should give a somewhat realistic idea of how long each development phase should take.
						</p>
						<p>
							It <i>does</i> include room for adjustment based on feedback from playtesting, or any additional features that may be proposed during
							development. Delivering a high-quality experience for players is our highest priority. If that comes at the expense of our pre-existing timeline, so be it.
							Valve put this philosophy into much better words than I ever could, so I won't twist my tongue trying to do a better job than they did.
						</p>
						<p>
							But it's very unlikely it would. I'm confident with these estimates.

							<h1>John Connor</h1>
							<h2>Lead Developer, Level Designer</h2>

							<p>
								I started fooling around with computers at a young age, but I wasn't really any good at it until I was 17 or 18. Though programming
								was and generally still is my strongest suit, I have quite a lot of experience in level design from hobbyist side projects I've taken on
								in games built on in both Source and Source 2.
							</p>
							<p>
								Video games are my lifeblood; there's really nothing else I know nearly as much about or can do as much with as game dev. That is to say:
								This project is one I am passionate about, and truly believe you should be, too.
							</p>
							<p>
								I've spent a lot of time playing games like these, and I've spent a lot of time around <i>others</i> who have played games like these.
								I know what kind of issues we should expect developing a game like this, I have ideas for how we should tackle them and I know many good
								names to reach out to during the playtesting stage of development.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<div class="pfp">
								<img src="img/profiles/empty.webp" />
							</div>

							<h1>TBD</h1>
							<h2>Assistant Developer</h2>

							<p>
								To deliver on all the promises I've made, I'll need at least one <span class="whoa-neo">Assistant Developer</span> to help me build
								everything. Though I've only listed one position here, if we have surplus funding after meeting our needs it will go toward hiring
								additional developers for this purpose.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<div class="pfp">
								<img src="img/profiles/empty.webp" />
							</div>

							<h1>TBD</h1>
							<h2>Composer, SFX Artist</h2>

							<p>
								As detailed in the <span class="whoa-neo">Music</span> subsection, a dynamic music system is planned for the game. In order for this
								system to be developed, the music <i>itself</i> is going to be needed. To match the complexity of what I have planned, I'll need to
								work in close proximity to the composer and be in constant contact with them, so I'd prefer to hire an in-house <span class="whoa-neo">Composer</span>
								as compared to simply outsourcing the work by contracting one.
							</p>
							<p>
								I'd also like to have original SFX engineered for the game if possible, and while I have a little experience in that area it <i>probably</i>
								won't be enough for a game given the scale I've envisioned and detailed here.
